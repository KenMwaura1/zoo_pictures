## User stories
As a user of the application I should be able to:

- View different photos that interest me. :heavy_check_mark:
- Click on a single photo to expand it and also view the details of the photo. The photo details must appear on a modal within the same route as the main page. :heavy_check_mark:
- Search for different categories of photos. (ie. Travel, Food). :heavy_check_mark:
- Copy a link to the photo to share with my friends. :heavy_check_mark:
- View photos based on the location they were taken. :heavy_check_mark:
